# Image Captioning
**Tools and Technology used:** Python, PyTorch, openCV, NumPy, matplotlib

Image caption generator is a task that involves computer vision and natural language processing concepts to recognize the context of an image and describe them in a 
natural language like English. In this project I am using a pre-trained ResNet50 as an encoder (which encodes the context of an image) and defining an LSTM network as a decoder (which decodes the context of the image) to generate a caption.
