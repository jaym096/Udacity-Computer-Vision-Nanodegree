## Landmark Detection and tracking using SLAM

Implemented SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for a 2 dimensional world for a robot, to detect and keep track of landmarks through the combination of motion and sensor data that was gathered over time. The 2D world is created for the robot with random initialization of the landmarks on the map.
